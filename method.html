<h2 id="h2"><span style=font-size:35px;><u><br><br>ONLY WEAR AS MUCH CORRECTION AS YOU NEED</u></span><br><br>The method to prevent and reverse myopia - "Reading at the far point" also called "Print pushing"
    Is a method developed by very insightful people many years ago. <br><br>
    How does it work?
</h2>
<p id="p">
   <u>** First of it is important to understand that there is no quick fix, an easy way, or a magic pill that will instantly give you perfect vision.
   This method requires a motivated and patient person with strong resolve in order to be successful. It is also unlikely that moderate to high myopes can fully recover and get back to normal vision as it's possible that excessive elongation of the eyeball occured, which may not be fully reversible, however
     moderate and high myopes can still expect to improve their vision by a few diopters. With that in mind, let's continue:
   </u><br><br>
    You need to be very slightly undercorrected for the distance you're looking at. 
    The glasses you've been prescribed to the distance give you perfect vision for the distance 
    but are excessively strong for working on the computer or reading a book. If you read the Explanations tab above
    and now understand diopters, you know that a distance of 67cm for instance (computer work) equivalent to 1/0.67m = 1.50 diopters of strain
    , you will therefore need glasses that are 1.50 diopters weaker than your distance prescription.<br><br>
    So if you wear -3.00 diopter glasses for infinity, you will only need -1.50 to see your computer at 67cm.
    <br> If you do that you will then see there might be a very slight amount of blur from 67cm
    This is a good sign, and you will to keep reading at this distance until the slight blur clears away. You will then 
    push the screen a little further until again there's a slight blur, and you'll be clearing it away in the same way<br<br>
    With time, you will see that you could increase the distance up to which you see some blur, which means 
    your myopia decreases. You will then need less than -3.00 diopter glasses in order to see 20/20 for the distance.
     <br><br>
     Another example: A distance prescription of -4.50, reading a book at 40cm: 40cm is equal to 1/0.4 = 2.50 diopters of near vision strain , therefore
     -2.00 glasses for reading would give a slight blur at 40cm
<br><br>
If your nearsightedness is low, in order to get the "slight blur effect" you will need to wear plus lenses (reading glasses)
For example: A distance prescription of -1.00, playing on the computer from 50cm - 1/0.5 = 2 diopters of near strain means 
+1.00 glasses will give the slight blur effect.<br><br>
This method could also be used while wearing contact lenses. In this case the person would need to wear 
plus lenses on top of the contacts when doing near work. <br><br>
For example: a -3.50 contact lens prescription for the distance, working at 40cm (2.50 diopters of near strain), will need +2.50 glasses to
have a slight blur.
<br><br>
Ideally, you can also practice the same method (and in fact you should) with distance glasses. 
You will need glasses that are slightly undercorrected (0.25 to 0.50 diopters) in order to get the same "slight blur" effect. <br>
So if you need -2.50 for instance to see 20/20 on an eye chart, you could reduce it by half a diopter, to -2.00 so you could see
20/30 to have some blur challenge for the distance, which will be slowly cleared.
<br><br>
The "slight blur" effect forces the focusing muscle(ciliary) to relax, and when it relaxes 
distance vision will be clearer.<br><br>
Normally people see results in the first few weeks, but completely relaxing the focusing muscle may take 6-12 months when This
technique is done correctly. Also, it is possible that nearsightedness will not be completely reversed if too much damage is done , and abnormal elongation
of the eye occured.
<br><br>
*Resolve patience and long term motivation required to see results.
This is not a quick fix, but it is the only method that works
