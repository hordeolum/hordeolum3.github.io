<h1 id="h1"><br><br>Frequently asked questions:</h1>
<p id="p"><b>Did you invent this method?</b>
    <br><br>
    - I haven't. I learned it from and founder of the International Myopia Prevention Association<br> <b>Donald Rehm</b> and from <b>Otis Brown</b> from
<span style="color:blue;">"preventmyopia.org"</span> and <span style="color:blue;">"https://myopiafree.wordpress.com/"</span> <br>
I'd also like to give credit to the very insightful Jacob Raphaelson and Prentice, both optometrists in the 1930's who did the same thing
<br><br>
<b>Does this method really work?</b>
<br><br>
- It does, but requires patience and long term motivation to see the desired results. One can normally expect up to a few diopters of improvements in 6-12 months time
<br><br>
<b>What about the bates method?</b>
<br><br>
- This is not the bates method, and unfortunately, the bates method and eye exercises do not work for the simple reason 
they don't address the core problem of nearsightedness which is relaxing the focusing muscle inside the eye, a process that takes months of consistency
<br><br>
<b>Why didn't I hear about any of this from my optometrist/eye doctor?</b>
<br><br>
Optometrists and eye doctors aren't taught the cause of myopia at school, they learn how to diagnose and correct refractive errors.
Most never even heard of the many years and findings of Dr. Francis young - that the eyes are dynamic.
<br> Some professionals do know this, but realized the patients are usually not motivated enough or interested
to actually do something about it, and prefer a quick fix - glasses, contact lenses and refractive surgeries
