     <h1 id="h1">You need glasses</h1>
     <p id="p">I started becoming nearsighted myself when I was 15. 
         I remember the first trip to the local optometrist who prescribed me -1.25 lenses. <br>
        The last thing I wanted is to wear glasses for the rest of my life, I hated the look of them and didn't want 
         to be called four-eyes. <br>My visual acuity was around 20/60 at that time, which means I could see at 20 feet what people with normal vision
         saw at 60 feet. <br>
         I've been told by the optometrist that nearsightedness is inherited and genetic and decided to take their word for it, despite the 
         advice of my mom who knew the prolonged hours of near work actually lead to me being myopic.
         <br><br>
         A few years later when I did my mandatory military service, my curiosity got the better of me.
         I started asking myself questions of why exactly did I become nearsighted. What could possibly be the reason?
         How could such thing be genetic? It all sounded a bit weird especially when almost half of my friends were myopic
         <br><br>
         I then started searching the internet for answers, vision improvement methods. I came across the famous "Bates method" 
         but after trying it for months had no success. <br><br>
         Almost giving up on vision improvement, very fortunately , I stumbled upon
         a video - "Myopia, a modern yet reversible disease" which changed my life.
         The guy giving the lecture (Todd Becker) explained the real reason for myopia, showing 
         a bunch of academic papers and scientific studies which all pointed in the same direction - MYOPIA
         BEING ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAUSED BY NEAR WORK. <br>
         Not only that, but the usual treatment for myopia (minus lenses) actually worsen myopia. This made 
         a lot of sense and reflecting back, all my friends who actually wore glasses or contact lenses were the ones who had moderate to high
         myopia, whereas those who didnt, like me, stayed at low myopia. <br><br>
         Not too long after, I came across a podcast where a man named Donald Rehm was interviewed.
         Apparently, Donald Rehm was an engineer and dedicated his life to spread the truth about myopia. 
         He even made his own website and wrote a book about it called "The Myopia Myth" in which he explains
         how myopia can be prevented and reversed if caught early by a simple technique - "Reading at the far point/Print pushing"
         <br><br>
         One of the reasons why I became an OD is to help save the eyes of the next generation, to help spread the truth and make a changed
         in an industry that is only focused on immediate symptom treatments completely disregarding the inevitable and permanent side effects that come with it.
