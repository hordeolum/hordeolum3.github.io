        <u>THE EYE IS DYNAMIC</u></h1>
        <h2 id="h2">What is nearsightedness?</h2>
        <h3 id="h3">Nearsightedness, Shortsightedness or Myopia is the inability to see distance objects clearly and is caused by:
            <br><br>1. Excessive near work, such as reading or playing on the computer for hours a day, every day, causes a focusing muscle spasm, also called "Pseudo-myopia" or "Fake myopia". THIS IS COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE.<br>
     <br>       2. The use of glasses, that make the initial problem worse over time eventually leading to excessive elongation of th eye, also called "Axial myopia" or "Real myopia". THIS MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE. <br><br>
           EXPLANATION OF THE REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE: <br><br>
There is a muscle in the eye, called the ciliary muscle, that controls the lens inside the eye that focuses to different distances. When looking to the distance, the muscle is relaxed and the lens is flat. When looking up close, the muscle tenses, the lens
thickens, in order to focus near objects on the retina.<br>
Prolonged near work causes the focusing muscle inside the eye to lock up and be stuck in close up mode.
            Objects in the distance will be therefore blurred as the lens can't relax to the distance.
            <br> Glasses are then prescribed, but they do not treat the initial problem, but rather fix the SYMPTOM - blurry vision to the distance.
            Glasses for myopia, also called "Minus lenses" optically move the whole world closer from a focusing standpoint
            so wearing them for near causes even more focusing effort which results in further deterioration and lock up of the ciliary muscle.
            <br><br>
            **When too much strain and effort is put on the focusing muscle, as a defense mechanism, the eyeball grows abnormally 
            so that it could do the same near work with less focusing effort. A longer eyeball = higher amount of nearsightedness.

    <u><span style="font-size:35px;">Diopters and how do they work</u></span><br>
<br>
    Diopters are basically 1 divided by the distance in meters. For instance, a person who is 
    2 diopters nearsighted, can only see up to 0.5 meters clearly (1/0.5 in meters = 2)
     A person who sees clearly up until 25cm or 0.25m is 4 diopters myopic. (1/0.25 = 4)
      A person who can see up to 1.33 meters clearly is 0.75D myopic (1/1.33 = 0.75)<br><br>
      So you can basically quickly measure your eyesight with a ruler, you measure the distance until you notice very slight blur, in good lighting
      in front of your computer for example, you then do 1 divided by that distance in meters, and that is approximately your distance prescription. Ordering these glasses will give you 20/20 or better vision (normal)<br><br>
<b>Visual acuity</b><br><br>Distance measured in feet or meters, written as 20/20 (6/6 in meters), 20/30 20/40 etc. <br>
20/20 (6/6) means that you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 20 feet. <br>
20/40 (6/12) - 50% of normal vision - you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 40 feet 
<br>20/10 (6/3) - twice as good as normal vision - you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 10 feet<br><br>
*Normal people can actually see better than 20/20, but it was taken as a standard and an average vision of older people.<br>
*In order to legally drive a vehicle without glasses only 20/40 is required
